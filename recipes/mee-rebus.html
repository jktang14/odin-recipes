        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Sweet Potato
                <ol>
                    <li>Bring a medium-sized pan of water to boil.</li>
                    <li>Peel and chop the sweet potato into cubes and drop them into the pan, with a tsp of salt. Bring back to a boil, then simmer for 15 minutes until the sweet potato is well done.</li>
                    <li>Drain then mash the sweet potato cubes and set aside until needed.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Peanuts(Skip this if using peanut butter)
                <ol>
                    <li>Place the raw or blanched peanuts in a small frying pan over medium heat and toast for 5 minutes. Turn the heat down to medium-low after 2 minutes, so the peanuts don't brown too quickly and burn. Keep tossing and flipping the peanuts until they are a light brown colour and giving off a sweet and nutty aroma.</li>
                    <li>When done, tip the nuts onto a large, flat plate and leave to cool for for at least 15 minutes or once you've got the mee rebus gravy going.</li>
                    <li>Place the toasted peanuts in a chopper and pulse to a fine state. Set aside to thicken the gravy.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                Mee Rebus Paste
                <ol>
                    <li>Peel and quarter the onion and drop into your chopper.</li>
                    <li>Slice off the tough bottom end (the root end) of the lemongrass. And cut off the top part, leaving about 10 cm/4 inches of stalk. Peel off the top layer, if it's particularly dry or dirty, or looking a little yellow. Rinse your lemongrass and dry. Using a sharp knife, slice your lemongrass into thin rings, then add to your chopper. Slicing your lemongrass makes it easier to be ground, as it is fibrous by nature.</li>
                    <li>Cut off the tough outer layer of the galangal and discard.Slice the galangal into thin rounds and place in the chopper.</li>
                    <li>Add all the other paste ingredients into the chopper and grind to a fine paste. So that's the shrimp paste, dried shrimp, taucheo and curry powder.Add a little water if you need it.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Mee rebus gravy
                <ol>
                    <li>Slice off the tough bottom ends (the root end) of the 2 stalks of lemongrass that are left. And cut off the top part, leaving about 10 cm/4 inches of stalk. Peel off the top layer, if it's particularly dry or dirty, or looking a little yellow. If not, leave it alone. Rinse your lemongrass and dry. Place your lemongrass on a chopping board and bash hard on the thick end with the back of your knife. This is called bruising your lemongrass.</li>
                    <li>Now heat the 3 Tbsp of oil in a large saucepan over medium heat and fry the ground paste and bruised lemongrass for 2 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Add the beef and mix well, breaking up the mince with yuor ladle. Fry the beef for 1 minute. Don't worry too much if it's on the dry side</li>
                    <li>Add the water and 1 tsp of salt, mix and bring to a boil.</li>
                    <li>Lower the heat, cover and simmer for 30 minutes. At the end of 30 minutes, add the sugar and ground nuts.</li>
                    <li>Lighten the mashed sweet potato with 2 ladles of the gravy, mix, then add that to the pot too. This will allow to mash to mix easier, instead of giving you lumps of mash.</li>
                    <li>Simmer uncovered for 5 minutes. Then check the seasoning, add more salt if you want. If the gravy is too thick, add a little more water and check seasoning again.</li>
                </ol>
            <li>While gravy is simmering
                <ol>
                    <li>Bring a large pot of water to boil. Add 1 Tbsp of salt. Drop the noodles in and cook for 1 minute. Drain, reserving the water, as we'll need to do the same to the beansprouts.</li>
                    <li>Repeat the blanching with the beansprouts for a minute too. Drain and set aside.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
