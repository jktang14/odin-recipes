            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Cooking the rice
                    <ol>
                        <li>If you have a rice cooker, just put everything in the rice cooker and press the cook button. Wait 10 minutes before opening the lid to fluff the rice</li>
                        <li>If you don’t own one, use a heavy-bottom pot. Bring the water, coconut milk, pandan leaves, and lemongrass to a boil and then add the rice. Bring it back to a gentle simmer and then close the lid. Cook for 5 minutes and then give it a stir to prevent coconut milk from catching. Close the lid back and cook for another 5 minutes. Turn off the heat. Wait 10 minutes before opening the lid to fluff the rice</li>
